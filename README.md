# E-Commerce Transactions Dataset Analysis
Overview
  This repository contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning models, and business insights generated from the eCommerce transactions dataset. The dataset includes details about customers, products, and transactions, and the objective is to analyze the data, derive actionable insights, and develop models for customer recommendations and segmentation.

# Dataset
The dataset includes the following files:

1] Customers.csv:
    Details about customersName, including their ID, region, and signup date.
    
2] Products.csv:
    Information about products, including ID, category, and price.
    
3] Transactions.csv:
    Details about transactions, including product quantity, total value, and transaction date.
  
# Tasks
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
   Goal: To analyze the dataset, uncover trends, and derive meaningful business insights.
   Key Insights:
    Identified top-performing product categories.
    Highlighted revenue trends by year, region, and product categories.
    Derived customer-specific insights such as lifetime value and purchasing patterns.
2. Lookalike Model
   Goal: To develop a model that recommends 3 similar customers for a given customer based on their profile and transaction history.
   Details:
    Used similarity techniques (e.g., cosine similarity or clustering) to find lookalike customers.
    Recommendations were generated for the first 20 customers in the dataset.
3. Customer Segmentation / Clustering
   Goal: To perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques to group customers based on their profiles and transaction behavior.
   Details:
    Applied clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) and calculated clustering metrics, including the Davies-Bouldin Index.
    Visualized clusters and provided business strategies for each customer segment.
